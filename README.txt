There once was a boy, a very freightened boy. He never played with the other children during recess because the voices in his head told him the other children would laugh and make fun of the boy. So instead, the boy drew creatures. Terrible creatures. Creatures with long legs, and black beady eyes that you couldn't seem to forget. One day during recess, the teacher came up to the boy and asked what he was drawing. The boy looked up and said plainly 'Myself.'
